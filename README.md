**The Architectural Blueprint: Building Your RAG System**
Here is how you build a system to give the model the knowledge it needs, exactly as you described.

1. The Knowledge Base: The "Source of Truth"
First, you need to collect all the data the model needs to be aware of. This is your "book." You will need to create data pipelines that regularly pull information from:

Live Cloud State (GCP & AWS):

GCP: Use the Google Cloud Asset Inventory API to export all resources for each project. This gives you a complete JSON snapshot of every VM, disk, database, firewall rule, etc.

AWS: Use AWS Config or run AWS CLI commands (aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources) to get a similar inventory for each of your accounts.

IaC State (Terraform):

Code: The raw .tf files from your Git repositories.

State File: The output of terraform show -json for each of your Terraform workspaces. This tells you what Terraform thinks it's managing.

Monitoring Data (The Key to Smart Suggestions):

GCP: Use the Google Cloud Monitoring API to pull metrics for specific resources (e.g., average CPU utilization for a VM over the last 30 days, read/write IOPS for a disk).

AWS: Use the Amazon CloudWatch API to get the equivalent metrics.

2. The Data Pipeline & Vector Database (The "Librarian & Index")
This raw data needs to be processed and stored in a way the AI can quickly search.

ETL Pipeline: Create scripts (using Python, Go, etc.) that run on a schedule (e.g., every hour via a cron job or GitHub Action). These scripts perform the "Extract, Transform, Load" process:

Extract: Pull the data from the APIs mentioned above.

Transform: Break the large JSON files down into smaller, meaningful chunks. For example, one chunk for each VM, including its configuration, its recent monitoring data, and its corresponding Terraform resource block.

Load: Convert each chunk into a numerical representation (an "embedding") and store it in a Vector Database like Pinecone, Weaviate, or ChromaDB. This database is optimized for finding the most relevant chunk of text for any given query.

3. The RAG Orchestrator (The "Brain of the Operation")
This is the central application logic that handles a user request. Let's walk through your exact scenario:

Scenario: A developer opens a PR to add a new VM to "project-alpha".

Trigger: A GitHub Action triggers your orchestrator application when the PR is opened. It extracts the target project_id ("project-alpha") from the PR description or a file in the PR.

Retrieval (The "Finding the Right Pages" step): The orchestrator formulates a series of queries to your vector database:

"Find all existing VMs in GCP project 'project-alpha'."

"Get the 30-day average CPU and memory utilization for these VMs."

"Find the Terraform code for the new VM being proposed in this Pull Request."

Augmentation (The "Building the Prompt" step): The orchestrator takes all the retrieved data and constructs a single, massive prompt for the LLM. It looks something like this:

You are an expert Cloud Cost Optimization bot for my organization. Your task is to analyze a proposed new resource against the existing infrastructure and its performance.

**CONTEXT - EXISTING RESOURCES in project 'project-alpha':**
- VM 'instance-1': {type: 'e2-medium', avg_cpu: '15%', ...}
- VM 'instance-2': {type: 'e2-medium', avg_cpu: '12%', ...}
- VM 'instance-3': {type: 'e2-standard-4', avg_cpu: '75%', ...}
(and so on for all relevant resources...)

**CONTEXT - PROPOSED NEW RESOURCE:**
- Terraform Code: resource "google_compute_instance" "new_web_server" { project = "project-alpha", name = "new-web-server", machine_type = "n2-standard-8", ... }

**USER TASK:**
Analyze the proposed new resource. Given that most existing VMs in this project have very low CPU utilization, is the proposed 'n2-standard-8' machine_type appropriate? If not, suggest a more cost-effective alternative and explain your reasoning.
Generation (The "Answering the Question" step): The LLM receives this detailed prompt. It doesn't need to have prior knowledge of "project-alpha"; all the facts are right there. It can now reason effectively:

"I see the developer wants an n2-standard-8."

"However, all the provided context shows that similar machines in this project are barely used (e2-medium at 15% CPU)."

"Therefore, the proposed size is excessive. A smaller, cheaper e2-medium or e2-standard-2 is a much better starting point."

The final output is the well-reasoned suggestion you want, posted as a PR comment.

Model Choice for a RAG System
For this, you need a model with a very large context window, as the prompts you build will be huge.

Gemini 1.5 Pro: The absolute best choice for this due to its 1 million token context window. You can stuff an enormous amount of real-time data into the prompt.

Claude 3 Opus: Also has a very large context window (200k tokens) and excellent reasoning.

GPT-4o / GPT-4 Turbo: Strong reasoning and a large context window (128k tokens).

By building a RAG system, you create a powerful, factually-grounded agent that can provide intelligent, context-aware suggestions for your entire organization.
